2. [估计和预测 2019-nCoV 新型冠状病毒在武汉的爆发情况](https://github.com/YiranJing/Coronavirus-Epidemic-2019-nCov)
   - 阶段1: 估计武汉封城时的感染人数(借鉴帝国理工论文)
   - 阶段2: 模拟预测武汉封城后肺炎感染人数以及峰值(借助SIER(susceptible-exposed-infectious- recovered)模型)

3. SEIR Forecast, Yijun Wang, Owen Xu
  - This study seeks to forecast the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases. We find, under the assumptions of no quaratine intervention, Wuhan would have 1.7 million infectious at the epidemic peak on March 3, 2020; Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou would have 3.9, 5.2, 4.2 million infectious cases at the peak time in the middle of May. Sensitivity analysis shows that reducing half of the number of catchment size and the reproductive number would reduce the magnitude of epidemic by more than 60%, while lengthening the peak to June and duration of the epidemic to August.

4. Estimation of R0, Yijun Wang
 - This study seeks to estimate the basic reproduction number by deriving R<sub>0</sub> from the SEIR model. As of 2020-02-14, R<sub>0</sub> is estimated to be 2.41.
